## Features

- **Simple to Use**: Serve files from the current directory with a single command.
- **Customizable Port**: Change the port easily using the `-port` flag.
- **Port Persistence**: Remembers your last used port for convenience.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Close the server with `CTRL+C`.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Installation

Install WebServ directly from GitHub using `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/fernstedt/webserv@latest
```

> Ensure your `GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH` to use `webserv` globally. If not, you can add it with:
> ```bash
> export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
> ```

## Usage

### Start the Server

Run WebServ with the default port (8080):

```bash
webserv
```

### Specify a Custom Port

Set a custom port (e.g., 9090):

```bash
webserv -port=9090
```

The server will remember this port for future runs.

### Access the Server

Once running, you can access the server in your browser:

```
http://<your-ip>:<port>/
```

For example:

```
http://192.168.1.100:8080/
```

### Stop the Server

Press `CTRL+C` in the terminal to stop the server gracefully.

## Example Output

When running the server, you will see:

```
Serving HTTP on 192.168.1.100 port 8080 (http://192.168.1.100:8080/)

Run webserv with -port <port> to select any port.
(Close with CTRL+C)
